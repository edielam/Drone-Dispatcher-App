Here are the steps I would take to design a UI with React and Material UI to allow users to perform the actions you described:

First, I would set up a new React project using create-react-app or a similar tool.
Next, I would install Material UI by running npm install @material-ui/core or yarn add @material-ui/core.
I would then create a component for displaying a list of drones. This component would make a GET request to the API to retrieve a list of drones from the database. It would display the serial number, model, weight limit, and battery capacity for each drone in a table or list format.
I would create a form component for registering new drones. This component would allow users to enter the serial number, model, weight limit, and battery capacity for a new drone. It would make a POST request to the API to add the new drone to the database.
I would create a component for displaying information about dispatch and expected return times of drones. This component would make a GET request to the API to retrieve the current state and location of each drone. It would display this information in a table or list format.
I would create a form component for uploading details of medications to be loaded onto a drone. This component would allow users to enter the name, weight, code, and image of a medication. It would make a POST request to the API to add the medication to the database.
I would create a component for checking the loaded medication items for a given drone. This component would allow users to select a drone from a dropdown menu or search bar. It would make a GET request to the API to retrieve the list of medications loaded onto the selected drone.
I would create a component for checking available drones for loading. This component would make a GET request to the API to retrieve a list of drones that are currently in the IDLE or RETURNING state. It would display this list in a table or list format.
Finally, I would create a component for checking the battery level for a given drone. This component would allow users to select a drone from a dropdown menu or search bar. It would make a GET request to the API to retrieve the current battery level of the selected drone.
